Trivia Game with Timer Properties. 

This was a challenging project that I spent well over 15 hours on.

Needed to learn a way to create the quiz questions using objects.  Stumpled on the forEach loop method to create innerHTML text. 

Learned about the radio button and applied what I learned about timers for the countdown.  

I have developed some great skills from this assignment.
